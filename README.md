## How this site was built


### Screencasts for tutorials

I've never been one to learn much from watching video tutorials, but I've also started to realize that massively long written tutorials can be hard to digest. Even when the text includes screenshots, it's hard to express the flow of the work.

So I've been experimenting with quick screencasts, not more than a minute each, for my tutorials. I've tried to mix the best of both worlds: the visual appeal of videos with the expressiveness of text. The tradeoff is that I don't narrate my short videos, which makes them much easier to produce.

A nice side-benefit is that if I need to take screenshots, I can always do a screengrab of the video.








I used QuickTime to do screencasts.
