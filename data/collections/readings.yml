        After Nate Silver took his statistical brand to ESPN, the Upshot was created partly as a place to continue Silver's quantitative political analysis, but also to ["bring data into the daily news reporting"](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/20/opinion/sunday/public-editor-how-the-upshot-replaced-nate-silver.html). The Upshot publishes interesting and readable slow-down-and-look-at-the-data articles on a daily basis, as well as some of the best cutting-edge visualizations.

        As you might expect, the blog of the leading investigative news organization is filled with inspiring and thought-provoking essays on the craft of investigations. Two of my favorite categories of IRE posts include [Behind the Story](http://ire.org/tag/behind-the-story/), in which reporters provide what amounts to "how-to's" for their investigations, and [Transparency Watch](http://ire.org/blog/transparency-watch/), which keeps tabs on the ebb and flow of our right to public records.

    - name: Precision Journalism
      author: Philip Meyer
      url: http://www.unc.edu/~pmeyer/book/
      description: |
        Whether you're reading the 1970, 1991, or 2001 editions, Meyer's phenomenal work on bringing the scientific method to journalism is timeless. You can both be astonished at how much was done by reporters using dial-up modem, and be reassured that the core of investigative work remains the same no matter how technology changes.
      excerpt: |
        If you are a journalist or are thinking of becoming one, you may have already noticed this: They are raising the ante on what it takes to be a journalist. There was a time when all you needed was dedication to truth, plenty of energy, and some talent for writing. You still need those things, but they are no longer sufficient. The world has become so complicated, the growth of available information so explosive, that the journalist needs to be a filter, as well as a transmitter; an organizer and interpreter, as well as one who gathers and delivers facts.

      url: http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/books_vdqi
      description: |
        Just as relevant today as it was 30 years ago, Tufte's principles of infographic design are valuable for print and the web. The Boston Globe's blurb review put it best: "A visual Strunk and White."
      excerpt: |
        For many people the first word that comes to mind when they think about statistical charts is "lie." No doubt some graphics do distort the underlying data, making it hard for the viewer to learn the truth. But data graphics are no different from words in this regard, for any means of communication can be used to decieve.

    - name: Computational Journalism
      url: http://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2011/10/131400-computational-journalism/fulltext
      author: "Sarah Cohen, James T. Hamilton, Fred Turner"
      description: A paper on how modern computing can greatly expand the reach and output of public accountability journalism.
      excerpt: |
        Researchers and journalists are exploring new methods, sources, and ways of linking communities to the information they need to govern themselves. A new field is emerging to promote the process: computational journalism. Broadly defined, it can involve changing how stories are discovered, presented, aggregated, monetized, and archived.

    - name: How to Lie with Statistics
      url: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_to_Lie_with_Statistics
      author: Darrell Huff
      description: A highly readable primer on the confusing nature of statistics.
      excerpt: |
        This book is a sort of primer in ways to use statistics to deceive. It may seem altogether too much like a manual for swindlers. Perhaps I can justify it in the manner of the retired burglar whose published reminiscences amounted to a graduate course in how to pick a lock and muffle a footfall: The crooks already know these tricks; honest men must learn them in self-defense.

    - name: "The Data Journalism Handbook"
      url: http://datajournalismhandbook.org/
      description: A free compilation of wisdom and practical advice by data journalists around the world.
      excerpt: |
         Using data the job of journalists shifts its main focus from being the first ones to report to being the ones telling us what a certain development might actually mean. The range of topics can be far and wide. The next financial crisis that is in the making. The economics behind the products we use. The misuse of funds or political blunders, presented in a compelling data visualization that leaves little room to argue with it.

      description: |
        A report by [Tow Center fellow Alex Howard](http://towcenter.org/author/alexander/) on the wide-breadth of practiced data journalism.
      excerpt: |
        If reporting does become more scientific over time, it could benefit readers and society as a whole. A managing editor might float an assertion or hypothesis about what lies behind news, and then assign an investigative journalist to go find out whether it’s true or not. That reporter (or data editor) then must go collect data, evidence, and knowledge about it.

      description: |
        This book purports to be a practical tutorial of how to perform complex data science within your average spreadsheet program. Preposterous, I know, but Foreman is both an excellent teacher of technology and a writer of "why we do things [like data science] in the first place."
      excerpt: |
        The truth is most people are going about data science all wrong. They're starting with buying the tools and hiring the consultants. They're spending all their money before they even know what they want , because a purchase order seems to pass for actual progress in many companies these days.

    - name: "Homicide: A Year on the Killing Streets"
      author: David Simon
      description: |
        This is not a work of data journalism, per se, but David Simon's year of embedding himself in the Baltimore homicide squad is a revealing look at all the human and political factors that can skew a number as seemingly final and immutable as the count of a city's homicides.
      excerpt: |
        ...Supervisors in the homicide unit regard the white rectangle as an instrument necessary to assure accountability and clerical precision...The board reveals all: Upon its acetate is writ the story of past and present. Who has grown fat on domestic murders witnessed by half a dozen family members; who has starved on a drug assassination in a vacant rowhouse. Who has reaped the bountiful harvest of a murder-suicide complete with a posthumous note of confession; who has tasted the bitter fruit of an unidentified victim, bound and gagged in the trunk of an airport rental car.
