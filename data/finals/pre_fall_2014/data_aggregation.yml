      Sum up the total cost of items per state, and sort that cost in descending order

      i.e. Find the total amount of money each state received, and list it in order of which state received the most

      ``` sql
        SELECT SUM(quantity * cost) as total_cost
          FROM the_table
          GROUP BY state, county
          ORDER by total_cost DESC
