title: Data joining
background: The ability to join different data sets upon a foreign key relation.


questions:
  - title: Basic join on a common foreign key
    text: Create a new table that combines population data with each line item in the 1033 data.
    answer:
      SELECT * FROM census_data
        INNER JOIN military_items
          ON census_data.fips = military_items.fips

      TK Table
      Given a military_items table that doesn't have a fips listing, and given the fips_names table below:
      TK Table

      Join the two tables so that each military_items listing has a fips code

    answer: |
      ```sql
        SELECT fips_listings.code, military_items.*
          FROM fips_listings
          INNER JOIN military_items
            ON
              military_items.state  = fips_listings.state AND
              military_items.county = fips_listings.county
      ```

  - title: Joining and filtering
    text: |
      Given the military_items table and the census_data table, create a list of military items that were sent to counties with fewer than 6,000 people.

      TK
      Given two tables of military_items, except that one contains items only sent to the state of New York, and the other contains items sent to the state of California, list


  - title: Left join filter on null
    text: |
      Given California and New York state military items, find all items that were sent to Kings County, New York, but *not* sent to Los Angeles County, California.

  - title: Left join to find missing entries
    background: Testing the use of LEFT JOIN. The class doesn't cover subqueries, so this problem can be solved by creating a new table and then joining against it.
    text: Find all items that were shipped before 2007, but not shipped after 2011
    answer: |
      TK
      SELECT pre_2007_items.item_name, pre_2007_items.ship_date, post_2011_items.ship_date
      FROM  leso_npr_cleaned AS pre_2007_items
      LEFT JOIN
        (SELECT ship_date, item_name from leso_npr_cleaned WHERE ship_date >= '2010' group by item_name) as post_2011_items
          ON post_2011_items.item_name = pre_2007_items.item_name
      WHERE pre_2007_items.ship_date <= '2007'
        AND post_2011_items.ship_date IS NULL
      GROUP BY pre_2007_items.item_name
