    Let's examine the different variations of 'PROFESSOR':

          SELECT ClassTitle,
            ClassCode,
            COUNT(*) AS ct
          FROM florida_positions
          WHERE ClassTitle LIKE '%PROFESSOR%'
            AND EmployeeType = 'SALARIED'
          GROUP BY ClassTitle, ClassCode
          ORDER BY ClassCode ASC, ct DESC;

    This query results in:

    |----------------------------------------+-----------+-------|
    |  ClassTitle                            | ClassCode | ct    |
    |----------------------------------------+-----------+-------|
    |  PROFESSOR                             | 9001      | 6289  |
    |  ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR                   | 9002      | 5546  |
    |  ASSOC PROFESSOR                       | 9002      | 2     |
    |  VISITING ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR          | 9002      | 1     |
    |  ASSISTANT PROFESSOR                   | 9003      | 6231  |
    |  VISITING ASSISTANT PROFESSOR          | 9003      | 1     |
    |  GRADUATE RESEARCH PROFESSOR           | 9006      | 19    |
    |  DISTINGUISHED PROFESSOR               | 9007      | 284   |
    |  UNIVERSITY SCHOOL PROFESSOR           | 9016      | 2     |
    |  UNIVERSITY SCHOOL ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR | 9017      | 10    |
    |  UNIVERSITY SCHOOL ASSISTANT PROFESSOR | 9018      | 63    |
    |  DEAN/ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR              | D102      | 1     |
    |  PROVOST/ASSOC. PROFESSOR              | P102      | 1     |
    |----------------------------------------+-----------+-------|
    {:.table-sql}

    Some of these titles may not fit what we intend to count. What is a `'UNIVERSITY SCHOOL ASSISTANT PROFESSOR'`, for instance? Is it worth including people who are professors but have a different primary role at the university, such as `'DEAN/ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR'`. The "correct" answer, if there is one, isn't unambiguous, so you may choose a different filter than I do. However, I think it's safe to say that we want to include, at the very least, jobs with a `ClassCode` from 9001 to 9003.

- title: "How many men versus women are in positions of leadership?"

  description: |
    This is another question that can have multiple answers depending on what you consider a "leadership" position to be. As we've seen already, there are plenty of variations on `'PROFESSOR'` alone.

    Here's some sample approaches to discovering how the state of Florida describes a leadership position for its universities:

    ##### The job titles of the people who make the most

    ##### The job titles of the people with `DEAN` or `PROVOST` or `VP` or `PRESIDENT`

    ##### Job titles
