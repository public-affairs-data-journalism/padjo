    The FBI gets a lot of criticism for undercounting or miscategorizing mass shooting incidents. But it's worth having a base definition:

    > An active shooter is an individual actively engaged in killing or attempting to kill people in a populated area, and recent active shooter incidents have underscored the need for a coordinated response by law enforcement and others to save lives.

     After the 2012 mass shooting in Aurora, Colorado, Mother Jones launched a five-month special investigation focusing on American gun laws and the apparent rise in mass shootings. Their project included an online database of mass shootings from 1982-2012, which they have updated with major shootings through 2015.

    This investigation found that mass killings in America happened "far more often" than what the government reports, and that their circumstances and the weapons used "are far more predictable than many might think."

    One astonishing takeaway from USA Today's reporting (emphasis added):

    > While only about 1% of all murders nationally, mass killings still happen frequently. The FBI counted 172 cases of mass killings between 2006 and 2011. __That does not include some large states such as Florida__, for example. Poor reporting by police agencies to the FBI also means some mass killings were left out, while others that donâ€™t meet the standard were included.

    [Unlike with U.S. police-involved homicides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_killings_by_law_enforcement_officers_in_the_United_States), Wikipedia users have not initiated a seperate project for general mass killings in the United States.
