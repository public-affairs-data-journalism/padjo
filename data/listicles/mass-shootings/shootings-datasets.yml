The spreadsheet also contains a separate sheet categorizing the weapons used in each incident.

    - We excluded crimes of armed robbery, gang violence, or domestic violence in a home, focusing on cases in which the motive appeared to be indiscriminate mass murder

  description: |
    Among the datasets listed here, USA Today has the most comprehensive and complex data schemas, with separate JSON files for events and victims.
  definition: |
    To analyze mass killings, USA TODAY used the FBI's definition: 4 or more killed, not including suspects, in an event. The killing may stretch over a day or more and some distance, especially if it includes killings committed in flight or against targeted people. It does not include an extended "cooling-off period" to distinguish this kind of crime from the acts of serial killers.
