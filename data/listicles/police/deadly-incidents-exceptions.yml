- title: "What is not included in The Counted?"
  description: |
    Self-inflicted deaths during encounters with law enforcement. For instance, a person who died by crashing his or her vehicle into an oncoming car while fleeing from police at high speed is not regarded by the Guardianâ€™s database to have been killed by law enforcement.

    The database does not include suicides or self-inflicted deaths including drug overdoses in police custody or detention facilities.

    In mass shootout incidents, like the one in Waco, Texas, where police have failed to identify those who were killed by law enforcement and those killed by civilian gunfire, the Guardian has been unable to log individuals in the database. We will make every effort to include this information when more details are provided.
