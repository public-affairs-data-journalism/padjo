    From the [DOJ press release](http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/department-justice-releases-report-philadelphia-police-departments-use-deadly-force):

    > Through its 48 findings, the assessment identifies serious deficiencies in the department’s use of force policies and training, including a failure to maintain a certified field training program; deficient, inconsistent supervision and operational control of officer-involved shooting investigations and crime scenes; and oversight and accountability practices in need of improvement, the most notable being the need for the department to fully cooperate with the Police Advisory Commission.
