- Find the year, and how many babies, for which your name was the most popular across the United States (i.e. with a `state` of `USA`). Write the query to show only the year and the number of babies.
- For the U.S., select all rows with your name for all available years, export to CSV, make a line chart.
- Find the five states for which your name was most popular in the year 2014. Then, use that list of states in a second query to get all of the records for your name/sex, export it, create a pivot chart.
