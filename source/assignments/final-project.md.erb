deliverables: |
  Create a __Folder__ in your PADJO2015 folder named: __PADJO2015-FINAL-PROJECT__.

  In that folder should be these files:

  - __Final-Project-Article__ - A __document__ aimed at the general reader, containing these components:
    - Prose of at least 500 words in typical journalism style, explaining what you've created, the context for doing so, and why it is an important/interesting data story.
    - Should also have a static screenshot of both the data chart and the data map (see more below), as well as URLs to that map and chart.
      + __A data map__: Something similar to the [QGIS mapping assignment](/assignments/qgis-mapping), in which data is filtered and mashed up (such as boundaries and point data). You can use CartoDB.
      + __A data chart__: Maps are bad at showing things like change over time and so forth. So make an interactive online chart that shows a view of the data that is _not_ geographic.
  - __Final-Project-Writeup__ - This is a __document__ containing these sections:
      - Links and summaries to __3 other previously-published stories in the news media__ that relate to your topic, including how these articles helped you define your own project.
      - Discussion about the __visual design choices__ you made to make the story clear, including how you decluttered the data, the color choices you made, and so forth.
      - A walkthrough of the data steps, including:
        + Where you got the data, including a link to the landing page _and_, if possible, a direct link to the data download, i.e. a zip/csv/shapefile/etc
        + The SQL queries you used to filter the data.


  Please do this assignment on your own.

requirements:
  - Ana's [story last week is a great example to follow](http://peninsulapress.com/2015/11/23/sfo-airplane-noise-complaints/).
  - Make a data map, CartoDB will be your best option likely
  - Make a data chart -- using Google Sheets (and Pivot tables, if necessary) is probably your best choice.
  - You should have done at least a couple SQL queries to get the data into an interesting shape. If you managed to find a story in which the data involved simple clicking-to-download-then-uploading...that story might not be very complicated.

# Ana's story on airport noise complaints

# Tufte and Snow

[Revisiting a past discussion](http://fall2014.padjo.org/2014-10-07/), recall that it was possible to visualize the data of the cholera epidemic as a map and chart. Obviously, you want to make a chart that _isn't_ pointless:
