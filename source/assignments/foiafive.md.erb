deliverables: |
  Create a __Folder__ in your PADJO2015 folder named: __PADJO2015-FOIAFIVE__.

  In that folder should be __6 files__:

  - A spreadsheet titled __FOIAFIVE-LIST__ with these fields named with this exact capitalization and order:
      - `title` 60 to 100 word headline of what's going on, "Request for bathroom cleaning fees for years 2010 to 2015"
      - `agency` - To whom you are requesting data from, e.g. "City of Palo Alto Sanitation Department"
      - `addressee` who are you addressing it to, name and job title, e.g. "Public Information Officer John Doe"
      - `precedent_url` - A url to some other story or record where you got inspiration for this from. Ideally, another FOIA letter that you have to modify. [Muckrock is a good place to start](https://www.muckrock.com/).
      - `date_sent` - the day that you sent the email
      - `date_first_response` - the day of the first response (even if it's an autoresponder)
  - A document for _each letter you send_

requirements:
  - It doesn't have to be much different than the first FOIA assignment.
