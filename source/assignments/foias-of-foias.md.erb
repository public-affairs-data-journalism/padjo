title: FOIAs of FOIAs

  The fact that your requests for public records are themselves public records is both a logical meta-consequence of the law and something you can use to your advantage.

A little while ago, I was Googling for additional updates to taxi data released by the New York Taxi and Limousine Commission. I stumbled across my own name in this [Github repo from developer Aaron Schumacher](https://github.com/ajschumacher/foilfoil). The repo contains a CSV of the response received by journalist [Samantha Sunne](https://twitter.com/SamanthaSunne) in her request for "all the FOIL requests submitted to the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission."

You can see the [CSV on Schumacher's repo](https://github.com/ajschumacher/foilfoil/blob/master/FOIL%20Report%20-%201_1_14to1_31_15.csv). I've made a mirror [here](/files/data/FOIL%20Report%20-%201_1_14to1_31_15.csv) (which I assume I can just directly copy, because hey, it's a public record).

I appear in <%=link_to_github_repo_source_file "line 907", "/files/data/FOIL%20Report%20-%201_1_14to1_31_15.csv", line: 907 %>
