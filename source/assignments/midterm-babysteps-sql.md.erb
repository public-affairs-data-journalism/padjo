  Create a Document in your PADJO2015 folder named: __PADJO2015-MIDTERM-BABYSTEPS__.

  Every problem should have its own page devoted to it. So if there 16 problems, your document should have 16 pages.

  If you work with a partner, both of you must turn in a separate document, but indicate (on the first page) the name of your partner.

requirements:
  - Download the [__National data__ zip file](https://www.ssa.gov/oact/babynames/names.zip) of baby names from the [Social Security Administration](https://www.ssa.gov/oact/babynames/limits.html).
  - Extract the 1990 and 2010 files and create a SQLite database with 2 tables, `babynames_1990` and `babynames_2010`, respectively
  - For each problem, write the SQLite query that will return the given result.
  - Your query must return the same results -- including the same column headers and format.
  - You may work with one other person. Be sure that both of you actually know how to solve all of the problems.

# Getting started

Read through these tutorials to make sure you understand joins:

- <%=described_inline_link_to_resource "/tutorials/babynames-and-college-salaries/011-querying-2014-baby-names"%>
- <%=described_inline_link_to_resource "/tutorials/babynames-and-college-salaries/024-creating-tables-importing-data"%>
- <%=described_inline_link_to_resource "/tutorials/babynames-and-college-salaries/030-all-about-inner-joins"%>
- <%=described_inline_link_to_resource "/tutorials/babynames-and-college-salaries/035-left-joins-and-join-practice"%>
- <%=described_inline_link_to_resource "/tutorials/babynames-and-college-salaries/045-self-joins-and-nested-joins"%>

Then follow the [instructions on how to create and import data](/tutorials/babynames-and-college-salaries/024-creating-tables-importing-data), except create tables for `babynames_1990` and `babynames_2010`.
