deliverables: |
  Create a Google spreadsheet in your PADJO2015 folder named: __PADJO2015-MORECRIME-PIVOTS__

  It should include 2 different histograms and/or pivot tables:

  - Using the SF crime incident dataset that contains [August 2014 _and_ August 2015](/files/data/sf-crimes-august-2014-2015.csv), create a chart, or even just a table, showing me something _specific_ and interesting about how incident reports changed from 2014 to 2015. An easy one would be: "_Crimes categorized as Assault fell x% from 2014 to 2015_" But the `Category` column is too broad, so find me something more interesting.
  - Repeat the same thing for another city (see the __Requirements__ for the links), but get the data yourself.


requirements:
  - You don't have to make a visualization if you don't want to. If you can filter/reduce the data to a few rows and columns that make your point, then great.
  - Download the [CSV data and import into Google spreadsheets](/files/data/sf-crimes-august-2014-2015.csv)
  - For the second chart/table, pick a city: [Chicago](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Crimes-2001-to-present/ijzp-q8t2#), [Los Angeles](https://data.lacity.org/A-Safe-City/LAPD-Crime-and-Collision-Raw-Data-2014/eta5-h8qx?), or [Dallas](https://www.dallasopendata.com/Police/Dallas-Police-Public-Data-RMS-Incidents/tbnj-w5hb). Use their respective web site tools to filter by date and export.
  - As you'll see very quickly, every other city does not categorize crimes the same way that San Francisco does.

Obviously, the [tutorial on pivot tables and earthquakes will be very handy](/tutorials/spreadsheets/maps-earthquakes-spreadsheets-part-2).

Download the [SF 2014-2015 August data for this exercise here](/files/data/sf-crimes-august-2014-2015.csv).

The [data originally came from the SF data portal](https://data.sfgov.org/Public-Safety/SFPD-Incidents-from-1-January-2003/tmnf-yvry)
