deliverables: |
  Create a Google spreadsheet in your PADJO2015 folder named: __PADJO2015-SFCRIME-PIVOTS__

  It should include 3 different histograms:

  - A histogram in which Burglary-type crimes are grouped by __hour of day__
  - A histogram in which Assault-type crimes are grouped by __hour of day__
  - Top 10 categories of crime, city-wide


requirements:
  - Download the [CSV data and import into Google spreadsheets](/files/data/sf-crime-2015-08.csv)
  - It doesn't matter how many spreadsheets or pivot tables you use, though obviously you'll need at least one spreadsheet (of the CSV) and a pivot table.

Obviously, the [tutorial on pivot tables and earthquakes will be very handy](/tutorials/spreadsheets/maps-earthquakes-spreadsheets-part-2).

Download the [data for this exercise here](/files/data/sf-crime-2015-08.csv).
