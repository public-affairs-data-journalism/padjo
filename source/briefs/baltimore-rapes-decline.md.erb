title: Baltimore's strange rape decline
---

How do we use untrustworthy data?


In 2010, [Baltimore Sun crime reporter Justin Fenton](http://www.justinfenton.com/?page_id=2) not only built a clear, logical refutation [against something as infuriatingly opaque and politically controversial as rape statistics](http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/crime/blog/bal-city-rape-statistics-archive,0,7495701.special). But he did it so convincingly that his work immediately [effected a dramatic change in policy](http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/bs-md-ci-sex-offense-changes-20110630,0,5877598.story). And he started with the same flawed, public data that the police and the politicians had access to but apparently overlooked.



### A dramatic and strange decline

In the year 2009, the Baltimore police reported 158 rapes. Moving past the sentiment that one such crime is too many, the first thing to question is: how _significant_ is __158__? Is that more than expected for a city of Baltimore's size? Fewer? The easiest route of comparison is to look at that number _historically_, i.e. the number of rape reports, year over year:

#### Overall success in crime prevention?

It's possible that Baltimore has had _exceptional_ success with reducing crime overall compared to the rest of the nation. It's possible there has been a significant investment in police funding, as well as an implementation of innovative law enforcement strategies ([a real-life Hamsterdam](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamsterdam#Title_reference)?).

We can confirm that theory by __comparing across categories__. We should see a dramatic drop in other categories of crime, such as homicide. Let's look at the [FBI Uniform Crime Reporting for Baltimore's homicide and rape numbers](http://www.ucrdatatool.gov/Search/Crime/Local/LocalCrimeLarge.cfm) (officially labeled as, "Murder and nonnegligent manslaughter" and "Forcible rape", respectively)

Because the population fluctuates, it's more relevant to look at __crime rates__: in this case, number of crimes per 100,000 citizens:


| Year | Homicide rate | Rape rate |
|------|---------------|-----------|
| 1985 |          27.6 |      76.8 |
| 1986 |          30.6 |      84.2 |
| 1987 |          29.5 |      77.8 |
| 1988 |          30.6 |      67.7 |
| 1989 |          34.3 |      70.9 |
| 1990 |          41.4 |      93.3 |
| 1991 |          40.6 |      93.7 |
| 1992 |          44.3 |      99.1 |

| 1995 |          45.2 |      95.9 |
| 1996 |          46.1 |      89.5 |
| 1997 |          43.4 |      66.7 |
| 1998 |          47.3 |      70.8 |
| 2000 |          40.1 |      56.2 |
| 2001 |          38.7 |      44.8 |
| 2002 |          37.7 |      26.5 |
| 2003 |          41.9 |      31.6 |
| 2004 |          43.5 |      28.7 |
| 2005 |            42 |      25.3 |
| 2006 |          43.3 |      21.6 |
| 2007 |          45.2 |      23.4 |
| 2008 |          36.9 |      21.6 |
| 2009 |          37.3 |      24.7 |

Charting that data leads to the graph below: whatever has led to the drop in rape reports has not affected the rate of homicides:
