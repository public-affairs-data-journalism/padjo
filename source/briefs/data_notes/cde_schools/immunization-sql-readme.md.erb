### Some stories

[Areas of Low Vaccination Rates Pose Risk to Students - The New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/12/us/12bcvaccines.html?_r=0): 

> Thousands of Bay Area kindergartners start school without proof of required immunizations, data from the California Department of Public Health show.

> While the rate of vaccination for kindergartners in the region — about 92 percent — is consistent with the state over all, public health officials say pockets of low vaccination rates at some schools may pose a risk. “For most of our vaccine-preventable diseases, you’ve got to get up to 85 to 95 percent coverage to have adequate protection,” said Dr. Mark Netherda, deputy health officer for Sonoma County. “These kids are in classrooms where 40 percent or more of the kids aren’t vaccinated. You get a case in there and it’s like a powder keg.”
