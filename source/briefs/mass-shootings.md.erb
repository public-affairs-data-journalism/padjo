> "Accurately accounting for mass killings — having a definition, sticking to the definition, trying to find all the incidents — that may seem somewhat pedantic but it's actually very important."

> To get a more accurate count, USA TODAY began with 156 such incidents reported to the FBI from 2006-11. But after investigating each one and finding others missing, USA TODAY found the FBI data had an accuracy rate of just 61%, throwing doubt on conclusions that might be drawn from analyzing it.

Interesting that Wikipedia attempts to track U.S. police-involved killings and school shootings, but not mass shootings.
