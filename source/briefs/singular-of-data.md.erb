title: The singular of data is anecdote
description: |
  Data is just as biased and dirty as any anecdote. This understanding is the foundational starting point of the best best data journalism.

Data aficionados are fond of the saying "_The plural of anecdote is __not__ data_," because it affirms the importance of basing decisions and judgments on wide-scale, objective measurements.

This is not a bad philosophy. As a civic society, we don't want to enact new laws or divert massive funds based on that crazy thing that happened to your uncle (or on Tumblr) two-or-15-years-ago. However, the perception that anecdotes -- i.e. individual stories and observations -- are inherently different if not _inferior_ to data when it comes to conveying truth has two _harmful_ implications:

1. __That data is _not_ made up of anecdotes.__ This is a disempowering mindset that discourages individuals from collecting data on their own when "official" data simply does not exist.
2. __That data is inherently more trustworthy than anecdotes.__ While a spreadsheet or database schema imposes structure on data, they have little to say about how the data was actually collected.

It's easy to assume in today's smartphone/Internet-of-Things/always-on age that the process of data collection is professional, objective, and complete. But the recent revelation that there has been no official collector of something as important [and _countable_ as police shootings](http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-many-americans-the-police-kill-each-year/) should be a reminder of how the very act of counting is inherently subject to political priorities and biases.

Likewise, the initiative taken by [public advocates](http://www.fatalencounters.org/spreadsheets/) and [journalism organizations](http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/series/counted-us-police-killings) to independently collect and analyze this data is evidence of how watchdog instincts and a structured approach can turn anecdotes into vital data.

As you begin learning and practicing data journalism, realize that every row in a database as a story. As you become more experienced, you'll learn that important stories can be found in the political reasons for the data collection, the technical steps of its collection process -- even the underlying details of the database schema -- and, of course, the data that _isn't collected_.




Nate Silver's take on Wolfinger, via his FiveThirtyEight opening essay, ["What the Fox Knows"](http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-the-fox-knows/):

> Wolfingerâ€™s formulation makes sense: Data does not have a virgin birth. It comes to us from somewhere. Someone set up a procedure to collect and record it. Sometimes this person is a scientist, but she also could be a journalist.
