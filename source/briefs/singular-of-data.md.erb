Every piece of data is a story. How that data is collected is a story. Why that data is collected is a story. And what data _isn't_ collected is a story.

From Nate Silver's ["What the Fox Knows"](http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-the-fox-knows/):

> You may have heard the phrase _the plural of anecdote is not data_. [It turns out that this is a misquote](http://blog.revolutionanalytics.com/2011/04/the-plural-of-anecdote-is-data-after-all.html). The original aphorism, by the political scientist Ray Wolfinger, was just the opposite: The plural of anecdote is data.

> Wolfingerâ€™s formulation makes sense: Data does not have a virgin birth. It comes to us from somewhere. Someone set up a procedure to collect and record it. Sometimes this person is a scientist, but she also could be a journalist.
