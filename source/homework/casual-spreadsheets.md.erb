  Make a [copy of this Google spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TnN5UpfaJ-7hiOb-QjBf_6p8uZk_LkCLh32XMAmnXow/edit#gid=1848607173) and place it into the Google Drive folder you've made for this class. Fill out the three sheets as described in the requirements.
requirements:
  - Create a Google Drive folder for this class and name it __PADJO2015-JDOE__, except put your own first initial and last name in place of "JDOE". This is where much of your class work will go.
  - Make the folder viewable and editable by me, i.e. dun@stanford.edu
  - Make a copy of this [Casual Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TnN5UpfaJ-7hiOb-QjBf_6p8uZk_LkCLh32XMAmnXow/edit#gid=1848607173) and place it in your own PADJO2015 folder. By default, it should be visible by me because it's in the folder.
  - Fill out the 3 sheets (after deleting the examples I've given) with 5 entries each.
  - __local-restaurants__ - Local places to eat that you've liked or at least have eaten at.
  - __people-to-fbi-foia__ - List relatively well-known and deceased persons whom you are interested in asking the FBI for their files. Make sure you can't already find their FBI file posted somewhere on the Internet.
  - __twitter-news__ - List news-related Twitter accounts that you follow.

Spreadsheets shouldn't just be used when you need to crunch data. They're a great tool for _organizing_ all types of data, whether it's a todo-list or even your reporting notes. Think of using a spreadsheet as a drafting tool for journalism. The extra overhead of a spreadsheet gives you the ability to easily sort and filter your information; you can always dump it into a regular text file when you have a better idea of the scope and shape of information you need to collect. 

In this exercise, you're asked to make a [copy of this workbook](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TnN5UpfaJ-7hiOb-QjBf_6p8uZk_LkCLh32XMAmnXow/edit#gid=1848607173) and fill out its 3 sheets (5 entries each). This could easily be done in a traditional, straight-forward list (e.g. "Hey, tell me your 5 favorite local restaurants"). 

But by collecting it in a spreadsheet, we make it very easy to organize data not just on a per-person basis, but to combine the data contributed by many people. This is the foundation for (sanely) conducting a crowdsourced, distributed data project.
