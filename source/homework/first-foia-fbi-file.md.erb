So that everyone can say they've made use of the federal public records law, we'll go with a well-known form: asking the Federal Bureau of Investigation for records on the deceased.

From the FBI's webpage, [Requesting FBI Records](https://www.fbi.gov/foia/requesting-fbi-records):

> The Freedom of Information Act allows any person -- except fugitives, federal agencies, and foreign intelligence agencies -- to request information about organizations, businesses, investigations, historical events, incidents, groups, or deceased persons.

Instructions and requirements for the request [can be found on the FBI's website](https://www.fbi.gov/foia/requesting-fbi-records). Here's a short list of resources relating to [FOIA'ing for FBI files](/briefs/foia-fbi-files)
