Please read [Stanford's Honor Code](https://communitystandards.stanford.edu/student-conduct-process/honor-code-and-fundamental-standard), the university's statement on academic integrity as written by students in 1921. 


### Use of technology in class

This is a computer-intensive class but I will do my best to post up-to-date and complete tutorials on the tools we cover, so that students can be focused on the in-class discussions and demonstrations without the burden of typing out notes on every detail. That said, in-class laptop usage must remain on task.


### Attendance

Compared to the other core classes, I'm relatively flexible on excused absences for lecture __if the reason is related to being on journalistic assignment__, i.e. an interview or event that cannot be rescheduled. Students are expected to notify me __72 hours__ in advance to receive approval.

Each unresolved unexcused absence may result in __a penalty of half-letter of a grade__.
