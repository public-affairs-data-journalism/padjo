  Just because it's data doesn't make it right. But even when all the available data is flawed, we can get closer to the truth with mathematical reasoning and the ability to make comparisons, small and wide.
---

In the [previous class](/2014-09-23), we saw a scenario in which there was effectively zero data. And then, how investigative reporters used an indirectly-related, but plentiful and reliable dataset, to make a [convincing case that police weren't policing themselves](www.pulitzer.org/works/2013/public-service/).

Today's scenario is different. There is seemingly _enough_ data. But on closer investigation, the data itself is at every level vulnerable to inaccuracies through miscounting if not outright manipulation.

So what's the point of knowing how to use data _at all_ if it can be so easily subverted? 

SPLIT_SUMMARY_BEFORE_THIS

In 2010, [Baltimore Sun crime reporter Justin Fenton](http://www.justinfenton.com/?page_id=2) not only built a clear, logical refutation [against something as infuriatingly opaque and politically controversial as rape statistics](http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/crime/blog/bal-city-rape-statistics-archive,0,7495701.special). But he did it so convincingly that his work immediately [effected a dramatic change in policy](http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/bs-md-ci-sex-offense-changes-20110630,0,5877598.story). And he started with the same flawed, public data that the police and the politicians had access to but apparently overlooked.


We'll attempt to recreate Fenton's analysis based on what he published. Obviously, it's easy to follow someone's footsteps, but the exercise is worth it to see the variety and scope of comparison and investigation Fenton did to build his case. His project is a textbook case of how to analyze numbers &ndash; even the tainted kind &ndash; to get closer to the truth.

-----------------

### A dramatic and strange decline

In the year 2009, the Baltimore police reported 158 rapes. Moving past the sentiment that one such crime is too many, the first thing to question is: how _significant_ is __158__? Is that more than expected for a city of Baltimore's size? Fewer? The easiest route of comparison is to look at that number _historically_, i.e. the number of rape reports, year over year:

via the [Baltimore Sun's graphics department](http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/bs-md-ci-unfounded-rape-g2.eps-20100627,0,3426286.graphic):

![img](/files/lectures/2014-09-25/baltimoresun/decline-rape-figures-since-2000.png)


If we restrict our inquiry to the past decade, we might conclude that 2009 is typical in terms of reported rapes. Although from 2000 to 2003, we do see a noticeable drop, implying that in 2009, Baltimore is near its historic low in this statistic.


However, when we expand the time frame further back into the 1980s:

![img](/files/lectures/2014-09-25/baltimoresun/declining-rape-figures.png)

&ndash; it appears that Baltimore has experienced a __dramatic__ drop: nearly an __80 percent drop__ from a high of 749 rape reports in 1992.

It's worth asking: is 80 percent a lot? According to the caption of the Baltimore Sun graphic, yes, as FBI statistics indicate an __8 percent drop__ nationwide.

#### Control for population 

What if Baltimore's population changed significantly?


The first thing we must do is _control for changes in population_. We should expect Baltimore's crime _overall_ to drop 80 percent if 80 percent of its population has moved out.

A Google search for ["Baltimore population"](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&es_th=1&ie=UTF-8#q=baltimore%20population) seems to invalidate that theory:

![img](/files/lectures/2014-09-25/baltimoresun/baltimore-google-pop.png)


#### Overall success in crime prevention?

It's possible that Baltimore has had _exceptional_ success with reducing crime overall compared to the rest of the nation. It's possible there has been a significant investment in police funding, as well as an implementation of innovative law enforcement strategies ([a real-life Hamsterdam](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamsterdam#Title_reference)?).

We can confirm that theory by __comparing across categories__. We should see a dramatic drop in other categories of crime, such as homicide. Let's look at the [FBI Uniform Crime Reporting for Baltimore's homicide and rape numbers](http://www.ucrdatatool.gov/Search/Crime/Local/LocalCrimeLarge.cfm) (officially labeled as, "Murder and nonnegligent manslaughter" and "Forcible rape", respectively)


|Year |Population | Homicides | Rape|

{: .data-table}


Because the population fluctuates, it's more relevant to look at __crime rates__: in this case, number of crimes per 100,000 citizens:


| Year | Homicide rate | Rape rate |
|------|---------------|-----------|
| 1985 |          27.6 |      76.8 |
| 1986 |          30.6 |      84.2 |
| 1987 |          29.5 |      77.8 |
| 1988 |          30.6 |      67.7 |

| 2001 |          38.7 |      44.8 |
| 2002 |          37.7 |      26.5 |
| 2003 |          41.9 |      31.6 |

| 2008 |          36.9 |      21.6 |
| 2009 |          37.3 |      24.7 |
{: .data-table}

Charting that data leads to the graph below: whatever has led to the drop in rape reports has not affected the rate of homicides:

![img](/files/lectures/2014-09-25/baltimoresun/homicide-rape-ucr-rates.png)


#### Ratio of homicides to rapes, nationwide and locally

In fact, the ratio of rape reports to homicides is so low that it places Baltimore among a very few cities in which there are more homicides than rape reports, according to this [Baltimore Sun infographic](http://www.trbimg.com/img-531cb5b0/turbine/bs-md-ci-unfounded-rape-g2.eps-20100627/979/933x979):

> __More homicides than rapes__: Nationally, there are five rapes for every murder committed. Out of 272 cities with a population of 100,000 or more, Baltimore is one of five recording more murders than rapes in 2009.

|      City     | Homicides |  Rapes  |
|---------------|-----------|---------|
| New Orleans   | 174       | 98      |
| __Baltimore__ | __238__   | __158__ |
| Baton Rouge   | 75        | 55      |
| Newark        | 80        | 68      |
| Detroit       | 361       | 335     |
{: .data-table}


### Volume and handling of rape calls

If the incidence of sexual assault had truly dropped, then we would expect not just a drop in the rape reports handled by detectives, but a drop in _emergency calls_ about rape. The Baltimore Sun included this graph, showing a relatively [steady volume of calls from 2003 to 2009](http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/bs-md-ci-unfounded-rape-g2.eps-20100627,0,3426286.graphic):

![img](files/lectures/2014-09-25/bsun-total-rape-calls.png)

Unfortunately, the Sun doesn't have the number of 911 calls about rape in years before 2003, so it's not possible to see if there was a corresponding drop (or not) as there was in rape reports. 

However, the Baltimore Sun's analysis of _how rape calls were handled_, from 2003 through June 2010, [revealed that](http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/baltimore-city/bs-md-ci-rape-review-update-20100803,0,5380655.story#ixzz3FPHGV626) "that __four in 10 calls__ to 911 during [the past 5 years] never made it to detectives specializing in sex crimes, having been dismissed by police officers at the scene with no report taken."

![img](files/lectures/2014-09-25/911-calls-pie-chart.png)


### A leader in unfounded rape cases

For the calls that did make it to Baltimore detectives, more than 30 percent of them would be "marked `unfounded` by detectives, meaning police believed the victim was lying." In this statistic, Baltimore led the country.


via [the Baltimore Sun](http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/bs-md-ci-unfounded-rape-g.eps-20100627,0,7327424.graphic):

![img](files/lectures/2014-09-25/unfounded-rape-reports-graph-baltimore-sun.png)

An advocate interviewed by Fenton offers this rhetorical question:

> "Why is it that women in the greater Baltimore area are more disposed to lying about sexual assault than anyplace else in America?" asked Branson of Turn Around. "Is it in the water? What exactly would make us the ones most likely to tell a story about being sexually assaulted?"



### Case work at the detective-level

Baltimore detectives interviewed by Fenton offered this rebuttal: the increase in "unfounded" reports was due to better police work](http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/bs-md-ci-rapes-20100519,0,2195896,full.story):

> Current and former sex offense detectives in Baltimore defended their investigations. Part of their mission, they say, involves rooting out illegitimate complaints that in the past would result in wasted effort and false arrests.

> Many reports of rape are made for "ill gain, in order to gain assistance or cover up not coming home," said one of the commanders of the unit, Lt. Thomas Uzarowski, in a March interview.

> "The bottom line is, the case is only unfounded when the investigative facts prove the crime did not occur," said Uzarowski, who retired from the department this month. "It's not an opinion. It's not anything other than where the facts fall."

This is a claim that's hard to directly measure. But Fenton scrutinizes the rape report numbers by *individual detectives*:

> The Baltimore squad that investigates sexual assaults and child abuse comprises 50 detectives. One of them, Detective Anthony Faulk Jr., is responsible for one-fifth of the unfounded reports, shelving 14 cases last year, including the alleged attack in midtown. No other detective had more than six such cases, and some have none. Attempts to reach Faulk through the department and police union were unsuccessful.

It's not a conclusive number, but it raises some doubt about better police work being the reality. If that were the case, how is it that one detective could have such a lopsided rate of unfounded reports? Is it because luck of the draw, or because he's doing the most thorough investigative work? Or is it, as critics believe, that there's simply no standard for evaluating rape claims, allowing detectives to too easily dismiss valid cases?


### Impact of Baltimore Sun investigation

Even before [Fenton's first story](http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/bs-md-ci-rapes-20100519,0,5338041.story) hit the presses, Baltimore Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake ordered an audit after she was contacted by reporters.

Baltimore Police Commissioner Frederick H. Bealefeld III declined to be interviewed in Fenton's first story, but after The Sun's story broke, Bealefeld admitted that there was a "crisis" and said of The Sun's reporting, "I can't tell you that we would have seen that by ourselves."

The Sun kept [following the numbers during the months](http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/crime/blog/bal-city-rape-statistics-archive,0,7495701.special) after Fenton's initial report. Before his June 2010 story, rape cases were down 15 percent for the year. By the end of August, [the number of rapes investigated by Baltimore police rose 20 percent since the year before](http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/baltimore-city/bs-md-ci-rape-increase-20100913,0,2385693.story).


Via the Sun's graphics department:

![img](http://www.trbimg.com/img-51414425/turbine/bs-md-rape-increase-g.eps-20100913/617/299x617)



["A year later, progress in Baltimore sex offense investigations"](http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/bs-md-ci-sex-offense-changes-20110630,0,5877598.story)

> A major category of crime is up substantially in Baltimore, and police and city officials are pleased.

> A year after The Baltimore Sun revealed that the city led the country in the number of rape reports discarded by detectives — part of what women's advocates and victims said was a broader pattern of ignoring sexual assaults — the number of rapes being reported is up more than 50 percent.



### The power of numbers


Rape occupies a special category of crime, a crime that most often takes place behind closed doors and in which victim and perpetrator are acquainted, making it a crime in which its incidence is less directly affected by the actions and policies of law enforcement. That alone makes rape difficult to count, even before acknowledging the unique social stigma of the crime.

As the [Baltimore Sun's editorial board put it](http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/opinion/editorial/bs-ed-baltimore-rape-statistics-20100628,0,7868922.story):

> Rape is different from other crimes. Not only does it involve a violation more profound than any other crime but it also comes with a social stigma that forces victims to relive the pain again and again. No one suggests that a victim of a carjacking was really asking for it. No one asks whether an assault might really have been consensual. When a robbery victim is on the witness stand, the most private details of her life are not dissected under cross examination.

There's little argument that rape is a heinous crime. But there's apparently much disagreement on how to judge an accusation. This uncertainty makes it difficult to objectively know whether or not rapes are being thoroughly investigated. And so for a decade before Fenton's 2010 report, how many valid accusations have been dismissed? And how many more would still be ignored today were it not for The Sun's investigation?


Below is the chart of rape and homicide rates for Baltimore through 2013, [according to FBI statistics](http://www.ucrdatatool.gov/Search/Crime/Local/LocalCrimeLarge.cfm):

![img](files/lectures/2014-09-25/baltimore-fbi-2013-stats-chart.png)

Just as profound as the Sun investigation impact on Baltimore's rape statistics (presumably a result from the [overhaul of the Baltimore Police's sex crimes unit](http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/bs-md-ci-sex-offense-changes-20110630,0,5877598.story)), is the realization that all the numbers &ndash; all the data, good and bad &ndash; were easily accessible to the FBI, the Baltimore police, and the politicians. 

But data being _accessible_ is not at all the same as the data being _known_. Kudos to Justin Fenton and the Baltimore Sun for paying attention and building a decisive investigation despite the inherently _bad_ data.

### Other examples of crime stat questions


- [The Truth About Chicago’s Crime Rates
](http://www.chicagomag.com/Chicago-Magazine/May-2014/Chicago-crime-rates/)

  > On October 28, a pathologist ruled the death of Tiara Groves a homicide by “unspecified means.” This rare ruling means yes, somebody had killed Groves, but the pathologist couldn’t pinpoint the exact cause of death...With the stroke of a computer key, she was airbrushed out of Chicago’s homicide statistics.

  > The change stunned officers. Current and former veteran detectives who reviewed the Groves case at Chicago’s request were just as incredulous. Says a retired high-level detective, “How can you be tied to a chair and gagged, with no clothes on, and that’s a [noncriminal] death investigation?” (He, like most of the nearly 40 police sources interviewed for this story, declined to be identified by name, citing fears of disciplinary action or other retribution.)

  > Was it just a coincidence, some wondered, that the reclassification occurred less than two weeks before the end of the year, when the city of Chicago’s final homicide numbers for 2013 would be tallied? “They essentially wiped away one of the murders in the city, which is crazy,” says a police insider. “But that’s the kind of shit that’s going on.”

  > For the case of Tiara Groves is not an isolated one. Chicago conducted a 12-month examination of the Chicago Police Department’s crime statistics going back several years, poring through public and internal police records and interviewing crime victims, criminologists, and police sources of various ranks. We identified 10 people, including Groves, who were beaten, burned, suffocated, or shot to death in 2013 and whose cases were reclassified as death investigations, downgraded to more minor crimes, or even closed as noncriminal incidents—all for illogical or, at best, unclear reasons.

  > Many officers of different ranks and from different parts of the city recounted instances in which they were asked or pressured by their superiors to reclassify their incident reports or in which their reports were changed by some invisible hand. One detective refers to the “magic ink”: the power to make a case disappear. Says another: “The rank and file don’t agree with what’s going on. The powers that be are making the changes.”



- [Detroit police routinely underreport homicides](http://www.detroitnews.com/article/20090618/METRO/906180406)

  > Detroit -- The Detroit Police Department is systematically undercounting homicides, leading to a falsely low murder rate in a city that regularly ranks among the nation's deadliest, a Detroit News review of police and medical examiner records shows.

  > The police department incorrectly reclassified 22 of its 368 slayings last year as "justifiable" and did not report them as homicides to the FBI as required by federal guidelines. There were at least 59 such omissions over the past five years, according to incomplete records obtained from the police department through the Freedom of Information Act.








## The Uber effect

In June 2010, [the Uber ride-sharing service launched in San Francisco](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uber_(company)#Establishment_in_the_U.S.). Besides changing our transportation habits, and the bottom-line of existing cab services, Uber believes it has also had a profound effect on public safety. 

From their blog: [DUI rates decline in Uber cities](http://blog.uber.com/duiratesdecline)

> We estimate that **the entrance of Uber in Seattle caused the number of arrests for DUI to decrease by more than 10%**. These results are robust and statistically significant. The diagram below illustrates the “Uber effect” relative to the baseline of DUIs.
> 

![img](/files/lectures/2014-09-25/baltimoresun/uber-duis-seattle-chart.png)



>...Uber is responsible for approximately -.7 DUIs per day, or more than a 10% reduction overall. However, this approach is inherently weakened by the fact that many things could have caused DUI to go down around the time when Uber entered. In order to test the robustness of this estimate, **we use San Francisco as a control city in a “differences-in-differences” framework**. The result is consistent:

![img](/files/lectures/2014-09-25/baltimoresun/uber-diff-and-diff.png)


The [Washington Post's Wonk Blog took a second look](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2014/07/10/are-uber-and-lyft-responsible-for-reducing-duis/) (and included Lyft's entrance) at San Francisco and concluded that more research was needed, but the raw numbers don't seem to contradict Uber's claims. The WaPo produced this chart from SF DUI numbers:

![img](/files/lectures/2014-09-25/wonkblog-dui_san_fran.png)


### Counter-claim: It's all about the policing

Some law enforcement officials remain skeptical, [SCPR.org reported](http://www.scpr.org/news/2014/07/22/45416/uber-takes-credit-for-big-drop-in-drunk-driving-bu/):

> Seattle Police Detective Drew Fowler said Uber shouldn’t be taking credit for reducing DUIs.
>
> “We have seen a decrease in the number of DUI arrests made," Fowler said. "If part of that can be assigned to the introduction of Uber, fantastic. But I don’t think proving the veracity of that is going to be very easy to do.”
>
> Fowler said it's more likely that DUIs have fallen because of a crackdown on drunk driving as part of a statewide initiative called Target Zero. 

Sometimes crime numbers drop because there are fewer police to make reports. Here, the Seattle detective thinks an increased police presence drove down DUI rates. 

And it always pays to remember: Correlation does not equal causation. It seems intuitive that Uber would allow more people to get home drunk without driving. But maybe those people stayed home before Uber was around, due to the inconvenience of having to find a ride home otherwise. Maybe Uber's real effect is that more people get to party who otherwise wouldn't &ndash; which is not a bad feat, by mind you.


### Let's make a pivot chart!

So what's the truth? Finding all the datasets across the different domains (such as number of liquor sales and bar business over time) is beyond our ability. But one thing we *can* do is just verify just one piece of Uber's evidence, something that's well within our means: [the DUI reports in San Francisco.](https://docs.google.com/a/stanford.edu/spreadsheets/d/1oUXIEc0Qxev34Lwt0Ocea_lCwRqcRCw4wWNz4elw4uc/edit#gid=0)


__The big picture:__ We want to re-create the [Washington Post Wonkblog's chart](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2014/07/10/are-uber-and-lyft-responsible-for-reducing-duis/); But we need to get the data in the right form. In fact, much of your difficult work in visualization (or any analysis) will be to get the data in the right form for whatever chart-making tool you're using.

We start out with a spreadsheet with every DUI report in the San Francisco crime incident database. Every report has its own row, and we may be able to count the total number of incidents (by counting up all the rows), but we can't figure out how many incidents there are by, say, per month and year:

![img](/files/lectures/2014-09-25/sf-duis-opened.png)


We need a thing that looks like this: A row for every __month-year__ combination, and a column that __counts__ number of incidents that have that __month-year__

![img](/files/lectures/2014-09-25/sf-duis-pivot-year-month-count.png)


And then we can chart it.

As an exercise, let's first chart the rate of DUIs by __hour__.

1. Open [Google spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/a/stanford.edu/spreadsheets/d/1oUXIEc0Qxev34Lwt0Ocea_lCwRqcRCw4wWNz4elw4uc/edit#gid=0)
2. Make a copy
3. Add some frozen panes, stretch out some fields
4. Add a column to the end of the sheet and name it `hour`
5. Add the formula `=HOUR(E2)` (assuming `E` is the `time` column) and calculate the formula down all the rows.
 
   ![img](/files/lectures/2014-09-25/sf-duis-hour-column.png)

6. Now make a __Pivot Table__
7. For the __Rows__ editor, we want to __Group by: hour__ (you can uncheck the __Show totals__ box, too). This ennumerates all the possible values in the `hour` column, i.e. `0` (midnight) to `23` (11PM):

   ![img](/files/lectures/2014-09-25/sf-duis-hour-pivot.png)

8. Now we need to create a second listing in our pivot table: _how many DUIs were reported per hour_; in other words, the kind of summary we want is a *count of the rows*. So in the __Values__ section, it doesn't matter what column you pick out. But for consistencies' sake, just pick `incidntnum`.

9. By default, the pivot table will try to __Display__ the __SUM__ of the incident numbers...which makes no sense for what we want to do. Change the __Display__ option to __COUNT__

10. To visualize this, we select from the menu: __Insert__ a new __Chart__. Check the __Use column A as labels__ (remember that the first column has what will be the __hour__ labels) and select the __Line__ chart (Google Charts may recommend a few irrelevant chart types at first):

As expected, based on Uber's findings, people tend to get caught driving drunk in the night (and comparatively rarely during, say, 10AM). 

Let's move on to our original goal: charting by __month and year__.

#### DUIs by month and year

Return to the original sheet (it should be called "Sheet1" in the bottom tabs) and now add a new column: `year_and_month`.

We want the values in this column to be a _combination_ of the __year__ and __month__ derived from the `date` column. This can all be done in one formula:

    =TEXT(D2,"YYYY-MM")

This is an admittedly esoteric-looking formula...but it's important because we need to extract just the year and the month so that we are __summarizing__ (i.e. counting) incidents per year and month, and _not_ by _each day_. The new column will look like this:

You can either make a new pivot table, or return to the previous one. If you do the latter, you have to __Edit [the] range__ since we've added a new column to the report.

Now, when you __Add field__ to __Rows__, the `year_and_month` option should show up. 

Select that. And then for __Values__, again pick a column and choose __Summarize by: COUNT__

The pivot table will now look like this:

And then insert a new chart as before to get something pretty similar to what the [WaPo Wonkblog has](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2014/07/10/are-uber-and-lyft-responsible-for-reducing-duis/):

#### Simplifying the data

In the Wonkblog piece, they note a curious trend in both the SF and Philly DUI numbers:

> It's also striking that **San Francisco and Philadelphia show a steep and parallel rise in DUIs** long before these services ever came to town; on both charts, it looks as if DUI numbers may be returning to an older normal as much as they've been falling. Perhaps these services have arrived on the market just in time to ride the benefits of an improving economy? (More theories on this welcome below as well).

Let's make some theories of our own. We can't do anything for Philly right now, but let's check out our SF numbers. Eyeballing the chart, it seems like the spike happened somewhere between 2008 to 2009 (Uber launched [in June 2010](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uber_(company)))

The problem with our current pivot table is there's too much data. So go back to the _original_ spreadsheet and add two more columns, just `year` and `month` (you can figure out the formulas yourself). Then re-adjust your pivot table to include those columns.

Let's make a simpler chart: Instead of grouping the __Rows__ by `year_and_month`, simply group by `year` and make a column chart of the results:

![img](/files/lectures/2014-09-25/sf-dui-year-column-chart.png)


2009 seems like a banner year for DUI reports. Let's look even _closer_ at that number by examining the data at a _monthly_ level.



#### Crosstab across year and month

So far, we've been using the pivot tables in the _simplest_ way: to aggregate across one dimension (counting incidents per hour, for instance). But pivot tables are especially useful for multiple dimensions, such as incidents per year, per month.

Well, we kind of did that with the "year_and_month" field, but that only generated a two column chart. You'll see the difference in what I mean if you do the following:

1. In the __Rows__ section of the __Report Editor__, change the __Group by__ field to the `year` column.
2. In the __Columns__ section, add the `month` field.
3. Set the __Values__ as before

You'll now get a nice cross-tabulation of the data:

Notice anything strange? In February 2009 (the column headed by `2`), there were __60__ DUI reports. In February 2008 and 2010, there were __35__ and __26__ incidents respectively. Make a chart of this pivot table to see the difference visually:

In the homework, you'll practice the use of Pivot Tables. I've posted a [complete walkthrough for the homework here](/tutorials/spreadsheets/basic-pivot-tables).
