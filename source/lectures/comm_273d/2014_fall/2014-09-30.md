> It would be nice if all of the data which sociologists require could be enumerated because then we could run them through IBM machines and draw charts as the economists do. However, not everything that can be counted counts, and not everything that counts can be counted. -- [William Bruce Cameron, “Informal Sociology: A Casual Introduction to Sociological Thinking”](http://quoteinvestigator.com/2010/05/26/everything-counts-einstein/)


If there is one correlation we've seen so far, it's that there's an unfortunate inverse relationship between the importance and the reliability of a dataset. We have solid data on how much we [tweet per second](https://blog.twitter.com/2013/new-tweets-per-second-record-and-how), [pay for a cab](http://chriswhong.com/open-data/foil_nyc_taxi/), [pass through a subway turnstile](http://chriswhong.com/open-data/visualizing-the-mtas-turnstile-data/). And not enough on occurrence of sexual assaults, officer-involved homicides (or speeding), the size of homeless population. 

This is not so different from just life, where the more important something is, the harder it is to get. If data is the record of an observation, then we should expect that the more significant an observation, the more significant its political and bureaucratic and personal implications. 



SPLIT_SUMMARY_BEFORE_THIS

### Homicide Watch


>In many cases, detectives and officers do not know what happens to a case once an arrest is made.  They never discover the outcome.

> From Laura Amico, founder of [Homicide Watch](http://contentsmagazine.com/articles/homicide-watch-an-interview/)

Homicide Watch goes beyond the collection of victim names and demographics, and their suspects, but also the resolution of the cases: tracking when the suspects were arrested, what they were charged with, and eventually, what they were charged with or not. The judicial process can take years and often falls beyond the scope of what the police collect, which is why there is no official database connecting arrests to convictions.

The [collection of data allows her to fact check the officials independently](http://homicidewatch.org/2011/12/30/understanding-mpds-94-homicide-closure-rate/).

> The database also tells me where my holes are. About once I week I go through the database and I look for what’s missing: obits, photos, times, anything, and I try to fill in what’s missing. Doing that means I’m always ready to slice and dice the numbers at a moment’s notice. Just recently we had three homicides in one night. As I was writing the story it occurred to me that, combined with deaths earlier in the week, that week might have the most deaths of any this year. I was able to prove that in just minutes and get that story up. I haven’t seen any other reporter with a database robust and agile enough to do that. - [An interview](http://contentsmagazine.com/articles/homicide-watch-an-interview/)

I cover the point of CSV and spreadsheets in this tutorial: [Why Spreadsheets?](/tutorials/spreadsheets/why-spreadsheets)



### Homicide and shooting data

[Slate is providing its year of gun deaths](http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/crime/2012/12/gun_death_tally_every_american_gun_death_since_newtown_sandy_hook_shooting.html) as a CSV, which you can [download here](http://slate-interactives-prod.elasticbeanstalk.com/gun-deaths/getCSV.php).

[Fatal Encounters](http://www.fatalencounters.org/), which is attempting to record all instances of officer-related deaths, [has posted their spreadsheet here](http://www.fatalencounters.org/spreadsheets/).

[Deadspin also launched a police-involved shooting database project](http://regressing.deadspin.com/deadspin-police-shooting-database-update-were-still-go-1627414202), covering the last three years of U.S incidents. Their Google [spreadsheet of submitted incidents can be found here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cEGQ3eAFKpFBVq1k2mZIy5mBPxC6nBTJHzuSWtZQSVw/edit).

### The difficulty in categorizing deaths

via: [Of Course Tamerlan Tsarnaev Is on Slate’s List of People Killed With Guns
](http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2013/06/19/tamerlan_tsarnaev_slate_interactive_of_course_the_boston_bombing_suspect.html)

The death of Tamerlan Tsarnaev illustrates how difficult it can be to count gun-related deaths.

- For starters, when such a list is used to make a point about "gun violence victims", some would (strongly) [disagree with Tsarnaev being characterized as a victim](http://www.thewire.com/politics/2013/06/mayors-against-illegal-guns-tamerlan-tsarnaev-slate/66413/).
- Even as a shooting-related death, law-enforcement-involved or not, Tsarnaev's death is ambiguous. He was hit by police gunfire, but he was also [run over by the SUV driven by his brother](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dzhokhar_and_Tamerlan_Tsarnaev#MIT_killing.2C_carjacking.2C_firefight.2C_and_manhunt). His death certificate states the cause of death as [“gunshot wounds of torso and extremities and blunt trauma to head and torso.”](http://boston.cbslocal.com/2013/05/10/city-releases-death-certificate-for-boston-bombing-suspect-tamerlan-tsarnaev/). Slate's editor told The Atlantic that their dataset includes ["killed-by-gun-plus-other-thing"](http://www.thewire.com/politics/2013/06/mayors-against-illegal-guns-tamerlan-tsarnaev-slate/66413/) incidents.

We'll cover more of these kinds of amiguities when [reading "Final Forms", by Kathryn Schulz](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/04/07/final-forms).



### Independent counting

The [Homicide Watch project](http://homicidewatch.org/), founded by Laura and Chris Amico:

From [Homicide Watch](http://contentsmagazine.com/articles/homicide-watch-an-interview/:


![img](/files/lectures/2014-09-30/homicide-watch.png)


> **Homicide Watch is sometimes used as an example of “data-driven” journalism, but I have to say, it doesn’t feel like a database or the kind of analytical, number-crunching project I associate with that term. It’s a very human-centric site. How does data enable what you do as a reporter? And conversely, how do your editorial choices shape your use of data?**

> Chris: In a lot of conversations about data in journalism, “data” is synonymous with “numbers.” We do plenty of numbers stories, but when we talk about data, we’re talking about organizing the information a reporter gathers into a regular and recurring structure. There are patterns in beat reporting, and we can build software that knows what we’re usually looking for, and that will tell you what you’re missing.
> For example, every murder victim has a name, age, race, gender, place of death (at the scene or at the hospital), cause of death (shooting, stabbing), and so on. We know when suspects are arrested, for which case, and how those cases end. That’s all data.
> What we’ve done that’s different, I think, is woven the data-centric parts of the site into the narrative parts. There’s really no separation. If the site works as it should, a user can land on a story and immediately see which victims and suspects are involved, understand the backstory, and where the case stands. Users shouldn’t have to guess about these things.
