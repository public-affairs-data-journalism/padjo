About Phillip: He and his colleague, Cynthia Hubert, were [finalists for the 2014 Pulitzer in Investigative Reporting](http://www.pulitzer.org/2014_investigative_reporting_finalist_2) for their reporting on a Las Vegas mental hospital that bused more than 1,500 psychiatric patients out to 48 states in 5 years. Their investigation resulted in ending the practice, [as well as the hospital being stripped of its accreditation](http://www.pulitzer.org/files/2014/investigative-reporting/sacbee/07sacbee2014.pdf).

From its [Pulitzer application](http://www.pulitzer.org/files/2014/investigative-reporting/sacbee/sacbeeletter.pdf):

> Hubert and Reese sifted through stacks of bus records acquired through public records act requests and found Rawson-Neal Psychiatric Hospital in Las Vegas had bused about 1,500 patients via Greyhound over the last five years to cities nationwide. The reporting showed that the hospital, dealing with funding cuts, simply got rid of patients, dispatching them on buses with bottles of Ensure for journeys to cities where some had never been.
> 
> Hubert and Reese spent months tracking down former patients and others from California to Maryland. They found and interviewed former patients serving prison time, staying in nursing homes and living on the street. They spent days knocking on doors of current and former Rawson-Neal employees in Las Vegas. Reese crisscrossed California researching criminal files and public records. They interviewed hundreds of people on the periphery and at the heart of the story.

### Notes from his discussion

Reese [uses a Chrome extension called "Page Monitor"](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/page-monitor/pemhgklkefakciniebenbfclihhmmfcd/reviews?hl=en) to quickly see if, among the hundreds of sites he's interested in, any have changed for the day.
