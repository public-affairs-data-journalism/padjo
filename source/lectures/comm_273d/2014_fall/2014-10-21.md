More about SQL. Please read and go through the following tutorials:

- [SQL data types](/tutorials/databases/sql-data-types) - Since we're using pre-built database files, you haven't had to worry about creating new data tables and specifying whether a column is a string, date, or number. This tutorial goes through some of the basics, including how to use various date/time-based function (i.e. find all the tweets between the hours of 9AM to 12PM)
- [The NULL state](/tutorials/databases/sql-null) - Related to data types: There's a difference between an _empty_ string, a 0, and a state of `NULL`, which is used to indicate that something is _undefined_. There's some new syntax involved, and knowing about `NULL` is very important for doing certain kinds of joins.
- [Updating and deleting rows](/tutorials/databases/sql-update-and-delete) - For the most part, we shouldn't be needing to change or delete from the data we work with. But when we need to, the syntax isn't too complicated.
- [Joins on many-to-one relationships](/tutorials/database-joins/sql-many-to-one) - When one table has many rows compared to another, e.g. many tweets per twitter_profile, we can perform aggregate functions (counting the number of tweets on a weekend per Twitter user) on the joined tables.
- [Left joins](/tutorials/database-joins/sql-left-joins) - This type of `JOIN` allows us to find values that appear in one table but not the other.
