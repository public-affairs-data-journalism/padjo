No books are required for this course, but readings will be assigned on a regular basis.

### Description

Even before the ubiquity of Internet access and high-powered computers, public accountability reporting relied on the concerted collection of observations and analytical problem-solving. We study the methods, and the data, used to discover leads and conduct in-depth reporting on public affairs, including election finance and safety regulations. Students gain practical experience with the digital tools and techniques of computer-assisted reporting. __Prerequisite:__ Journalism M.A. student.*


 
### Grading

The course grade is based off of:

- Turning in complete homework assignments on time (40%)
- Attendance (10%)
- A final project (50%)

The topic and form of the final project is up to the discretion of the student. These core concepts and skills must be demonstrated:

- Excellent news judgment: being able to find and tell a compelling story in the public interest
- The ability to join at least two different data sources
- The ability to research and describe the origins of the data, even if the data was collected manually by the student
- Addressing the limitations in the data, i.e. the "known unknowns"

Students are encouraged to use charts and other visualizations as necessary to illustrate the data, but won't be judged on aesthetics (unless the visual design serves to distort the data or mislead the viewer). The prose of the project should be roughly 1,000 to 2,000 words.




### Tools and technology

The work and exercises in this class should be doable with any Windows, Mac, or Linux computer capable of running a modern web browser.

- Text editor: I recommend Sublime Text. In the lab, we'll be using TextWrangler.
- Spreadsheet: In-class demonstrations will involve Google Spreadsheets. Microsoft Excel will also do fine.
- Database: In-class demonstrations will use Sequel Pro, which is available only for Mac. On your own laptop, I recommend (for ease of installation) installing the Firefox web browser and using the SQLite Manager.
