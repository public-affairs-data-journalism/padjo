Optional workshop on learning your computer more. Meeting time: TBA


### Things to do week of Oct. 9


#### System setup

##### Install the Sublime Text editor

[It's free for 30 days, and you can still keep using it afterwards](http://www.sublimetext.com/).

##### Learn how to get to the command line

- [OS X command-line](http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/introduction-to-the-mac-os-x-command-line)

- [Windows command line](http://dosprompt.info/)

#### Set up Ruby

Google instructions on how to get the __Ruby programming language__ installed on your machine. If you are on Mac OSX 10.8+, it will already be installed.

How do you know if it works? Go to your command line and type in: `ruby -v`


#### OSX: Set up homebrew

If you are on a Mac, install [homebrew](http://brew.sh/). You will also probably have to setup some XCode things...email me or google around if you have problems.


#### Install the t gem

[Follow the instructions here](https://github.com/sferik/t)


#### Find out who your most popular follower is

Use the t gem ([again, the instructions are more or less here](https://github.com/sferik/t)) to:

1. Download a CSV file of all your followers
2. Find the follower of yours who themselves has the most followers


Hint: You can do step 2 in a spreadsheet if you wish.

If you don't have a Twitter account or a popular one, find Peninsula's Press most popular follower.
