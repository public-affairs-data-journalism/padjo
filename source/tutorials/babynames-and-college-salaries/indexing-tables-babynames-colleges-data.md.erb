The SQLite documentation actually has a great, [readable explanation of how indexes are used to make searches faster](https://www.sqlite.org/queryplanner.html). I'll give my own bastardized version here.

Let's say I want to look up how many babies were named `'Daniel'` according to the `babynames` table. This is the query:

~~~sql
SELECT * FROM babynames
WHERE name = 'Daniel';
~~~

On my laptop, it takes just 35 milliseconds to return the 2 result rows.

|---------+-----+---------|
|  name   | sex | babies  |
|---------+-----+---------|
|  Daniel | F   | 148     |
|  Daniel | M   | 33809   |
|---------+-----+---------|
