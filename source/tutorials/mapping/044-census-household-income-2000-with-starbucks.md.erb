  How to combine a point data with shapefile data on the same CartoDB map (tutorial in progress)
listed: true
---


The [CartoDB map embedded above](https://daannguyen.cartodb.com/viz/3de1d1f6-9393-11e5-b7b7-0e3ff518bd15/public_map) overlays the location of present-day Starbucks locations on top of a choropleth map of Census 2000 data for median household income by Census tract.


This is a tutorial on how to use CartoDB's multiple layers feature to combine point and shapefile data.

(in progress, the barebones steps are described below)

# Data



## Census 2000 tract shapefiles

- Source: [NYC Planning Department: Political and Administrative Districts](http://www.nyc.gov/html/dcp/html/bytes/districts_download_metadata.shtml#cbt)
- Download: [Census Tracts 2000 (Clipped to Shoreline) (.zip)](http://www.nyc.gov/html/dcp/download/bytes/nyct2000_15d.zip)

## Census 2000 household incomes

Note, I've used a Python script to collate these five files into one. It's easy enough to do by hand, but you can just use my collated file:

[/files/data/cartodb/census_2000_household_incomes.csv](census_2000_household_incomes.csv){:.url}


If you're interested in collating the files yourself:

## Present-day Starbucks locations

I derived a list of Starbucks locations in New York by filtering the [database of the city's restaurant inspections](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Health/DOHMH-New-York-City-Restaurant-Inspection-Results/xx67-kt59) for businesses with `"STARBUCKS"` in the name.

The inspection dataset does not include geospatial data, so I wrote a Python script to use the [Mapzen Search API](https://mapzen.com/documentation/search/search/) to get latitude and longitude for each address -- [you can see the script here](https://gist.github.com/dannguyen/036a62e32fc9f6765b82). It's not completely correct, for example, some LaGuardia locations are geocoded to JFK Airport. But it's pretty good for a free service with barely any configuration on my part.

You can download the geocoded Starbucks locations as a CSV here:

[/files/data/cartodb/geocoded_starbucks.csv](geocoded_starbucks.csv){:.url}




# Adding the Census tract shapefiles

Here's the simple map of just the 2000 census tracts:

![image census-tracts-2000-nyc-plain.png](/files/images/tutorials/cartodb/census-tracts-2000-nyc-plain.png)


# Adding the Census households income data

After uploading the 2000 household income data, we can join it to the census tract shapefiles with this SQL:

~~~sql
SELECT nyct2000.*,
  total_households, median_household_income
FROM nyct2000
INNER JOIN household_incomes
ON household_incomes.borough = nyct2000.boroname
AND household_incomes.census_tract = nyct2000.ct2000;
~~~

The resulting choropleth:

![image census-tracts-household-incomes-2000-choropleth.png](/files/images/tutorials/cartodb/census-tracts-household-incomes-2000-choropleth.png)


# Adding the Starbucks point data

Upload the Starbucks data

## Add a new layer

In the sidepanel, click on the top panel labeled __Add layer__

![image add-layer.png](/files/images/tutorials/cartodb/add-layer.png){:.bordered}

This will prompt you to create an actual map:

![image a-map-is-required-to-create-layers.png](/files/images/tutorials/cartodb/a-map-is-required-to-create-layers.png){:.bordered}

Then it will take you to your list of datasets. Add the geocoded Starbucks dataset.
