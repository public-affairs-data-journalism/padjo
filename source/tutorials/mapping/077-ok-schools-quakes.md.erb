# Filter and display some dots

As always, we start with the simplest way to get things to show up on a map. Let's show _all_ (6,000+) of the earthquake points:

~~~sql
SELECT *
FROM ok_quakes;
~~~


![image ok_quakes_all_of_em.png](/files/images/tutorials/cartodb/ok_quakes_all_of_em.png)



## First, show the "big" earthquakes

It's a cool visual, but it has about __zero__ actual information value to those who aren't impressed with seeing a bunch of dots. So let's filter for just the _major_ earthquakes.


### What kind of quakes does Oklahoma normally have?

Well, how do we define "normal"? Not just for Oklahoma and earthquakes, but for anything in life? I honestly don't know. And honestly, I don't have the attention span to think about it while I'm trying to figure out SQL and spreadsheets.

So I'm just going to get a __group count__ of all the earthquakes, according to _groups_ of their __magnitude__, rounded to the nearest __integer__:



~~~sql
SELECT 
  ROUND(mag) AS rounded_mag,
  COUNT(*)
FROM ok_quakes
GROUP BY rounded_mag
ORDER by rounded_mag;
~~~

![image ok_quakes_histogram_mag.png](/files/images/tutorials/cartodb/ok_quakes_histogram_mag.png)


(Note: why do I convert `mag`, a column that is already a number, to `numeric`? I don't know enough about [PostgreSQL's number types](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.1/static/functions-math.html) but without that conversion, I was getting an error when trying to call the `ROUND` function with 2 arguments. So, this works for now...)

~~~sql
SELECT 
  ROUND(mag::numeric, 2) AS rounded_mag,
  COUNT(*)
FROM ok_quakes
WHERE mag >= 4.0
GROUP BY rounded_mag
ORDER by rounded_mag;
~~~


![image ok_quakes_histogram_mag_tenths.png](/files/images/tutorials/cartodb/ok_quakes_histogram_mag_tenths.png)

Just to keep things visually simple, I think we can define "major" earthquakes to be of at least __M4.5__. That means we can expect to see `8` earthquake points on the map:

~~~sql
SELECT *
FROM ok_quakes
WHERE mag >= 4.5;
~~~

![image ok_quakes_4-5-above.png](/files/images/tutorials/cartodb/ok_quakes_4-5-above.png)





### Trim and specify the fields we SELECT

And now, be less lazy and select only the fields we need:

~~~sql
SELECT
  ok_quakes.cartodb_id,
  ok_quakes.the_geom_webmercator
FROM ok_quakes
WHERE mag >= 4.5;
~~~

The map view won't change -- though there will be no earthquake-specific data (e.g. specific magnitude or dates) since we've left out those columns:

![image ok_quakes_4-5-above-no-detail.png](/files/images/tutorials/cartodb/ok_quakes_4-5-above-no-detail.png)

-----------


# Boundaries

You may have noticed that at least one of our __M4.5+__ earthquakes is not actually within Oklahoma's boundaries:

![image ok_quakes_4-5-above-no-detail.png](/files/images/tutorials/cartodb/ok_quakes_4-5-above-no-detail.png)

Or maybe you didn't. Because you aren't even able to pick Oklahoma from a state map. And the contrast of the map tiles, in which state lines are _not_ emphasized, isn't making it any easier.


So let's start our geospatial-querying with the very limited goal of just making the darn state of Oklahoma actually visible to normal-sighted human beings. 

## Adding a layer of county boundaries

Note: In this section, I talk about using the [__Add Layer__ feature of CartoDB](http://docs.cartodb.com/tutorials/multilayer_overview/). This has _nothing_ to do with SQL or geospatial analysis. It is simply a CartoDB-specific feature for their [interactive maps](http://docs.cartodb.com/tutorials/multilayer_overview/), to allow casual users to add multiple layers of visual imagery onto a map without doing any type of logical SQL joining.

I use the __Add Layer__ feature here just to remind you what shapefiles look like when rendered on a map, that's all. And also, that there's a difference between what we _see_, and what we tell the computer to _geospatially filter_.

After uploading the Oklahoma county boundaries -- [which can be found at this URL](http://geo.ou.edu/oeb/Statewide/COUNTY.zip) -- as a __new dataset__, I can go back to whatever map I was using to show the `M4.5` earthquakes.

In the sidepanel, I click on the top panel labeled __Add layer__

![image ok-add-new-layer.png](/files/images/tutorials/cartodb/ok-add-new-layer.png)

This will prompt me to create an actual map -- (but aren't we already on a map? Well, not technically -- and yes, that will seem confusing...):

![image a-map-is-required-to-create-layers.png](/files/images/tutorials/cartodb/a-map-is-required-to-create-layers.png){:.bordered}

Anyway, after creating a new map, I'm presented with my list of datasets, from which I add the Oklahoma county shapefiles. And here's the result:

![image ok-new-map-layer-counties.png](/files/images/tutorials/cartodb/ok-new-map-layer-counties.png)

OK, we've accomplished our goal: we can clearly see that one earthquake that is _north_ of Oklahoma. Now, let's __filter__ it out with SQL.

(At this point, I can just remove the counties layer...it was just a visual thing anyway...but I leave it in the following examples as a visual reference point)


## Geo-filtering with ST_WITHIN

Let's actually take a step back and think of the _pseudo-code_ -- i.e. the plain English steps of what we intend to do:

> Show only the earthquakes in which the latitude and longitude are _inside_ -- i.e. __within__-- the boundaries of the __state__ of Oklahoma.

Actually, we don't have the state boundaries, and I don't feel like looking up a new shapefile to download. But we can still use the _counties_ shapefile to the same effect:

> Show only the earthquakes in which the latitude and longitude are within any of the boundaries of Oklahoma's _counties_.

It's computationally different, but the effect is the same. Now let's think about the query. We can basically think of it as an `INNER JOIN` with the `ok_counties` dataset/table, with some kind of function/conditional statement in the constraint:

~~~sql
SELECT
  ok_quakes.cartodb_id,
  ok_quakes.the_geom_webmercator
FROM ok_quakes
INNER JOIN ok_counties
  ON SOMETHING_SOMETHING_SOMETHING
WHERE mag >= 4.5;
~~~


What is that `SOMETHING_SOMETHING_SOMETHING`? Well, just a placeholder for now, while we figure out the name of the geospatial function will do the job that we've described in pseudocode.

### The ST_WITHIN geospatial function

It's worth reading more CartoDB tutorials for the bigger picture; for example, this [example uses a function named __ST_INTERSECTS__](http://academy.cartodb.com/courses/sql-postgis/joining-data/#join-two-tables-by-geospatial-intersection).

For our purposes, the function [__ST_WITHIN__](http://postgis.net/docs/ST_Within.html) will serve the same purpose. This is how it's described:

> `boolean ST_Within(geometry A, geometry B);` -- Returns true if the geometry __A__ is completely inside geometry __B__

Whatever. But at least we can see that it returns `true` -- which is something we need a function to do when doing a `JOIN`. What is `geometry A` -- i.e. what are the names of the columns in our __ok_quakes__ and __ok_counties__ tables?

These are things related to CartoDB's specific operation. Go ahead and skim through their tutorial titled __[Geospatial Analysis](http://docs.cartodb.com/tips-and-tricks/geospatial-analysis/)__.

Then see if the following query makes sense to you (if not, re-read the tutorial, repeat, etc.):

~~~sql
SELECT
  ok_quakes.cartodb_id,
  ok_quakes.the_geom_webmercator
FROM ok_quakes
INNER JOIN ok_counties
  ON ST_WITHIN(ok_quakes.the_geom, ok_counties.the_geom)
WHERE mag >= 4.5;
~~~

Begone Kansas quake:

![image ok-county-join-quakesst-within.png](/files/images/tutorials/cartodb/ok-county-join-quakesst-within.png)

And thus, we've successfully told CartoDB, via SQL, how to filter geospatial data based on _logic and math_.

As you can see, we had to learn a new function -- `ST_WITHIN` -- but we used the basic SQL concepts we've used plenty of times before.


# Census population with U.S. Census FactFinder

Showing _where_ big earthquakes have happened in Oklahoma is not particularly newsworthy. To paraphrase one of those websites with Zen quotes, if a big earthquake happens and there's nothing to shake, did it really happen?

In other words, big earthquakes in unpopulated areas -- for which there might be substantial quantities of in Oklahoma -- aren't particularly newsworthy. So let's get some population data via the [U.S. Census's FactFinder](http://factfinder.census.gov/):

I suggest using the [Advanced Search](http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/searchresults.xhtml), which I detail below:



### Pick a topic

People > Basic Count/Estimate > Population Total

![image census-factfinder-menu-topic-pop.png](/files/images/tutorials/cartodb/census-factfinder-menu-topic-pop.png)


After closing the dialog box:

### Pick geography

![image census-factfinder-menu-geographies-census-tracts.png](/files/images/tutorials/cartodb/census-factfinder-menu-geographies-census-tracts.png)


#### Pick a state

All tracts, Add to your selections:

![image census-factfinder-menu-geographies-census-tracts-all-ok.png](/files/images/tutorials/cartodb/census-factfinder-menu-geographies-census-tracts-all-ok.png)

Close dialog


Pick Total Population

![image census-factfinder-menu-geographies-census-tracts-all-ok-total-pop.png](/files/images/tutorials/cartodb/census-factfinder-menu-geographies-census-tracts-all-ok-total-pop.png)

You can View it, to get a web-page friendly data:

This is what it looks like as a table:

{:.table-sql}  


Delete the second row, which contains human-friendly annotations (e.g. "Estimate; Total" and "Margin of Error; Total") before uploading to CartoDB. The result will look like this:

![image uploaded-acs-14-5yr-table.png](/files/images/tutorials/cartodb/uploaded-acs-14-5yr-table.png)

Joining it to the existing Census tracts shapefile (in my example, named `ok_tracts`) requires a simple `INNER JOIN` based on the two common fields:

- [acs_14_5yr_b01003](https://daannguyen.cartodb.com/tables/acs_14_5yr_b01003):  `geo_id`
- [ok_tracts](https://daannguyen.cartodb.com/tables/ok_tracts): `affgeoid`

~~~sql
SELECT 
  ok_tracts.cartodb_id,
  ok_tracts.the_geom_webmercator,
  acs_14_5yr_b01003.geo_display_label,
  acs_14_5yr_b01003.hd01_vd01 AS population
FROM ok_tracts
INNER JOIN acs_14_5yr_b01003 
  ON acs_14_5yr_b01003.geo_id = ok_tracts.affgeoid;
~~~

There's no need to join the `acs_14_5yr_b01003` table to the `ok_quakes` table -- we can simply add the population choropleth as a __new layer__, so that we can see where the big earthquakes fall in relation to the population centers:

https://modern-sql.com/feature/with

~~~sql
WITH big_ok_quakes AS (
  SELECT 
    time, mag, depth, place,
    cartodb_id, the_geom, the_geom_webmercator
  FROM ok_quakes
  WHERE mag >= 4.5
)
SELECT 
  big_ok_quakes.*
FROM big_ok_quakes
INNER JOIN ok_counties
  ON ST_WITHIN(big_ok_quakes.the_geom, ok_counties.the_geom);
~~~

Unfortunately, it looks like the big earthquakes are near some of Oklahoma's most population-dense centers:
