__SQL is difficult.__ For this course, it's going to be the single most difficult subject for most people, because it is a programming language. And even professional programmers find it challenging.

However, we're learning it for two important reasons:

1. To efficiently load and process datasets of 1,000,000+ rows. With Google Sheets, we run into performance issues with even just 10,000 rows.
2. To have a language for describing _exactly_ what we want to do with the data.

That second point will be the difficult concept. So this short walkthrough is intended to introduce the first point.

# Installing the SQLite Database browser

<% content_card "Stanford Journalism Lab installation" do %>
If you are a Stanford Journalism student, the Macs in the McClatchy lab already have the SQLite Browser installed. But you should install it on your own computers, too, for your own convenience.

You can download SQLite Database Browser from its homepage: [http://sqlitebrowser.org/](http://sqlitebrowser.org/)

~~~sql
SELECT IncidntNum FROM sfpd_incidents LIMIT 10
~~~


~~~sql
SELECT IncidntNum 
  FROM sfpd_incidents 
  LIMIT 10
~~~

~~~sql
SELECT IncidntNum, Category 
  FROM sfpd_incidents 
  LIMIT 10
~~~


Cause an error by using the wrong field name ("Description"):

~~~sql
SELECT IncidntNum, Category, Description
  FROM sfpd_incidents 
  LIMIT 10
~~~

~~~sql
SELECT IncidntNum, Category, Descript 
  FROM sfpd_incidents 
  LIMIT 10
~~~


~~~sql
SELECT Category, Descript, Resolution, Date, Time
  FROM sfpd_incidents 
  WHERE Time > "18:00"
  LIMIT 10
~~~




---------


## WHERE

~~~sql
SELECT Category, Descript, Resolution, Date, Time
  FROM sfpd_incidents 
  WHERE Time = 18:00
  LIMIT 10
~~~

The error:

        near ":00": syntax error: 


Use quotation marks for non-numerical values


~~~sql
SELECT Category, Descript, Resolution, Date, Time
  FROM sfpd_incidents 
  WHERE Time = "18:00"
  LIMIT 10
~~~


~~~sql
SELECT Category, Descript, Resolution, Date, Time
  FROM sfpd_incidents 
  WHERE Time > "18:00"
  LIMIT 10
~~~



### Change the LIMIT


~~~sql
SELECT Category, Descript, Resolution, Date, Time
  FROM sfpd_incidents 
  WHERE Time > "18:00"
  LIMIT 100
~~~


#### Removing the `LIMIT`

~~~sql
SELECT Category, Descript, Resolution, Date, Time
  FROM sfpd_incidents 
  WHERE Time > "18:00"
~~~
