## GROUP BY count

In a previous example, we found the number of unique boy names by executing this query:

~~~sql
SELECT name FROM baby_names
WHERE sex = 'M'
GROUP BY name;
~~~

If we wanted to find the number of girls, we could easily alter the `WHERE` condition:

~~~sql
SELECT name FROM baby_names
WHERE sex = 'F'
GROUP BY name;
~~~

__But__ we could get both bits of information in a single query:


~~~sql
SELECT sex, COUNT(*)
FROM baby_names
GROUP BY sex;
~~~

Note that we don't have to rely on the count.


| sex | COUNT(*) |
|-----|----------|
| F   |   350993 |
| M   |   282615 |

## AVG and GROUP BY

~~~sql
SELECT name, 
  AVG(count) AS average_count
FROM baby_names
WHERE sex = 'M'
  AND state = 'USA'
GROUP BY name
ORDER BY average_count DESC
LIMIT 5;
~~~


|   name  | average_count |
|---------|---------------|
| Jacob   |       19245.4 |
| Mason   |       17601.4 |
| Noah    |       17578.2 |
| William |       16889.0 |
| Ethan   |       16820.4 |
