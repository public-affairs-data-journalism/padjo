In a previous example, we found the number of unique boy names by executing this query:

~~~sql
SELECT name FROM baby_names
WHERE sex = 'M'
GROUP BY name;
~~~

If we wanted to find the number of girls, we could easily alter the `WHERE` condition:

~~~sql
SELECT name FROM baby_names
WHERE sex = 'F'
GROUP BY name;
~~~

__But__ we could get both bits of information in a single query
