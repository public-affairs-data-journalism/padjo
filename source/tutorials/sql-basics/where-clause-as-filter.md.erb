title: Using the WHERE clause to filter data in SQL
description: |
  How to retrieve rows based on whether they match specified values.
takeaways:
  - Where the `WHERE` clause fits in relation to `SELECT` and `FROM`
  - What the equals sign, `=`, means in SQL.
  - The use of `AND` and `OR` to specify multiple conditions.
  - Why `SELECT * from baby_names WHERE 1 = 1` will return all rows from the `baby_names` table.
  - Why `SELECT * from baby_names WHERE 1 = 2` will return no rows from the `baby_names` table.

    Recognizing the difference between: 
    - `'name' = 'name'`
    - `"name" = 'name'`
    - `'name' = 'Name'`
    - `"name" = 'Name'`
    - `"name" = "Name"`
