# Thursday, September 24
{:.day-lesson}

We talked a [lot about Texas and the FBI and FOIA laws](/briefs/foia-fbi-files)



------------




# Notes for Tuesday, September 22
{:.day-lesson}



For the first week, we'll discuss the term "data journalism", e.g. what _is_ data journalism, how is it done, how is it different from "non-data" journalism, etc, and get a grounding in fundamental tools (spreadsheets) and concepts (filtering and aggregation).


## How to find speeding cops

## FBI FOIAs

This class won't be covering the complexities of American public records law, but we can still practice it. Requesting a [FBI file for an individual person is a popular example of FOIA](/briefs/foia-fbi-files).


## In-class work

- Follow the [Casual Spreadsheets homework assignment](/assignments/casual-spreadsheets/) and create a folder on Google Drive: PADJO2015-DNGUYEN (put your first initial and last name instead of mine). Give edit permissions to dun@stanford.edu.
- Signup for [Github](https://github.com/) and the [Github Student Education Pack](https://education.github.com/pack). I'm not sure how far we'll go into the Github funland but approval for the education pack takes a few days/weeks.

## Pivot tables

For Tuesday and Thursday we'll be doing some in-class work with pivot tables. This is to get everyone re-acquainted with the spreadsheet and to understand the huge value that it brings to doing effective data work. Even after you've mastered SQL, you'll find that spreadsheets will be your go-to tool for most data tasks.

In class, we'll try to walk through: <%=my_link_to_resource "/tutorials/spreadsheets/sun-sentinel-speeding-miami-cops-exercise" %>.

And here's a pivot table walkthrough from last year that's worth practicing: <%=my_link_to_resource "/tutorials/spreadsheets/basic-agg-pivot-tables/" %>


__On Thursday:__ We'll focus more on visualization, or more accurately, how filtering and aggregation are necessary for making useful visualizations, rather than "noisy" [ones like this earthquake map](https://dundee.cartodb.com/viz/888634d0-60ae-11e5-93c9-0e018d66dc29/public_map.


### Odds and ends

Look, Google has analytics data for [our humble campus coffee shop](https://www.google.com/search?q=coho+stanford+cafe):
