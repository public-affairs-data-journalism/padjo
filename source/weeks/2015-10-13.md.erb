October 15 -  from the Sacramento Bee to speak.


## Guest speaker for October 15: Phillip Reese

Phillip Reese is the computer-assisted reporting genius at the Sacramento Bee and one of my former colleagues. He and fellow Bee reporter Cynthia Hubert were [finalists for the 2014 Pulitzer in Investigative Reporting](http://www.sacbee.com/news/investigations/nevada-patient-busing/) for their reporting on a Las Vegas mental hospital that bused more than 1,500 psychiatric patients out to 48 states in 5 years.
